# NYC_Air_Quality_Data_Analysis_Using_Machine_Learning

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the course ***CS 5834 Intro to Urban Computing*** at ***Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University***. This project was a joint effort of a group of 4 people enrolled in the course.

## Problem Statement

Goal of the project was to understand the Air Quality data of New York City and develop a streamlined approach towards it and finally develop a Machine Learning model which is capable of classifying the air quality of New York city based on the recorded measure for various toxins. Such a model can even be extended and used to understand the air quality for other cities in United States.

## Methods and Project Report

A [project report](Urban_Computing_Final_Project_Report.pdf) was developed with all the approaches used, methods with detailed analysis, building and evaluating the final proposed model.

Refer to the following Jupyter Notebooks for the detailed analysis and code:
1. [Exploratory Analysis and Visualization Notebook](CS5834_NYC%20Air%20Quality%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.Assessments_ML_R1.ipynb)
2. [Final code for Data Preprocessing, Model Building and Evaluation Notebook](Urban_project_2.ipynb)
3. As per the feedback received by professor we were questioned about the high accuracy of our model. Justification for that can be found in [Notebook with totally unseen regions in Bronx as testing data](Urban_project_4.ipynb)

Following csv and excel files were used in the above notebooks and can be found in the repository:
1. [6AQIDataset.FINAL.csv](6AQIDataset.FINAL.csv)
2. [UrbanProject.xlsx](UrbanProject.xlsx)
3. [UrbanProject_R1.xlsx](UrbanProject_R1.xlsx)
4. Exported excel with the final grading for the overall air quality of various regions in NYC after our detailed analysis and data preprocessing can be found at [UrbanProject_R1_FR.xlsx](UrbanProject_R1_FR.xlsx)
